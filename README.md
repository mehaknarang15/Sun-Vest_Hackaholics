# Sun-Vest
## Introduction
A platform enabling communities to invest in shared solar projects. Users can buy shares and track their energy savings.

## Project Overview
*Allows user to browse solar project listings, predicted energy generation, and personalized recommendations.
*The platform leverages Machine Learning to recommend projects based on the userâ€™s previous investment behavior, location, preferences, and risk tolerance.
*Investors receive financial returns based on the amount of energy generated by their share and can reduce their electricity bills.
*Users can estimate future savings through our platform, which calculates cumulative cost savings, CO2 reductions, and ROI over time, ensuring transparency in financial and environmental impacts.
*Our models forecast energy generation for solar projects using historical data and weather patterns, enabling informed investment decisions.
*Shared solar projects promote environmental sustainability by increasing the use of renewable energy sources

## Technologies and Tools Used
* Programming Languages: Python, HTML, CSS 
* Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
